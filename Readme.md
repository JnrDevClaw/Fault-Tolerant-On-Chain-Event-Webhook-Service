PROJECT NAME
Fault-Tolerant On-Chain Event Webhook Infrastructure

WHAT THIS IS

This service provides a reliable way to consume smart contract events as standard HTTP webhooks using only a contract ABI.

Instead of running and maintaining blockchain listeners, ABI decoders, retry logic, and failure handling in every application, teams integrate once and receive decoded, structured JSON events over HTTP.

The system is designed to reduce:

operational complexity

infrastructure surface area

duplicated logic across services

silent data loss from RPC or webhook failures

THE PROBLEM IT SOLVES

Most Web3 backends need on-chain events. Almost none want to operate blockchain listeners.

In practice, teams run into the same issues repeatedly:

Event listeners drop when RPC connections reset

Missed logs are discovered days later, if ever

ABI decoding logic is duplicated across services

Webhook consumers fail and events are lost

Scaling listeners becomes harder than scaling the app itself

The result is fragile infrastructure where correctness depends on everything staying up all the time.

This service exists to make event delivery boring, predictable, and auditable.

WHY THIS APPROACH WORKS BETTER

Fewer moving parts for the user

No RPC subscriptions to manage

No ABI decoding code in application logic

No retry queues to build and tune

Failure is handled centrally

Events are persisted before delivery

Webhook failures are retried automatically

Delivery state is observable and replayable

The integration surface is stable

HTTP in, HTTP out

ABI defines the contract, not infrastructure assumptions

Complexity scales once, not per project

One listener system instead of N

One decoding pipeline instead of scattered utilities

HOW IT WORKS (HIGH LEVEL)

Register a subscription
The user provides:

Chain ID

Contract address

ABI

Optional event filters

One or more webhook endpoints

Event ingestion

The service maintains chain listeners

Logs are captured as blocks are processed

Events are persisted immediately

Decoding and normalization

Logs are decoded using the stored ABI

Payloads are normalized into a consistent JSON schema

Delivery

Events are delivered to webhooks

Retries and backoff are applied on failure

Delivery attempts are recorded

EVENT PAYLOADS

Webhook payloads are delivered as clean, decoded JSON.

Each payload includes:

event name

contract address

chain ID

decoded event arguments

transaction hash

block number

block timestamp

log index

No raw hex unless the user explicitly wants it.

This makes downstream consumers simpler, testable, and language-agnostic.

FAULT TOLERANCE BY DESIGN

This system assumes failure is normal.

RPC connections drop

Nodes go out of sync

Webhook endpoints go down

Networks experience reorgs

To handle this:

Events are stored before delivery

Delivery is retried with backoff

Duplicate deliveries are expected and supported via idempotency

Failed deliveries can be replayed

The goal is correctness over optimism.

CUSTOMIZATION OPTIONS

Without increasing integration complexity, users can configure:

Event filtering (by event name or signature)

Multiple webhook endpoints per subscription

Retry limits and backoff strategies

Payload signing for webhook verification

Replay windows for historical events

The default configuration works out of the box. Advanced options are opt-in.

SECURITY MODEL

Webhook payloads can be cryptographically signed

Timestamps prevent replay attacks

No private keys are stored or managed

ABI validation prevents malformed decoders

This service observes the chain. It never transacts.

SCALING CHARACTERISTICS

The system scales by separation of concerns:

API layer is stateless

Event ingestion is shardable by chain or contract

Processing and delivery are queue-driven

Storage acts as the source of truth

High event volume affects throughput, not correctness.

WHEN THIS MAKES SENSE

This service is useful when:

On-chain events drive backend workflows

Missed events are unacceptable

Multiple services depend on the same contracts

Operational simplicity matters more than novelty

It is especially valuable for teams that want to focus on product logic rather than infrastructure plumbing.

NON-GOALS

Not a block explorer

Not a general indexer

Not a wallet or signing service

This tool does one thing: deliver smart contract events reliably.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- pnpm
- MongoDB (local or Atlas)

### Backend Setup

```bash
cd Backend
pnpm install
```

Create a `.env` file:

```env
PORT=3000
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/event-webhook-service
NODE_ENV=development
```

Run the server:

```bash
